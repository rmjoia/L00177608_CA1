I had some issues with the Quadrilateral, you'll see when you start the app.

The one that takes the rectangle as a parameter kind of works, but after two clicks to rotate (the bounding box doesn't rotate) it stops rotating, no full marks there :(

I suppose the rest of the criteria is met, but I guess you'll be the judge of that.

I used some lambdas here and there, and there are some "unaddressed" exceptions on those lambdas that I know wouldn't throw, so I wouldn't have to deal with optional types.

I also left a comment about a guard clause on the Quadrilateral constructor that takes an array of Points.
